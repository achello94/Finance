# Finance
Python for Finance repository as a way to integrate investment management knowledge with Python computer code

This repository contains some small programs that I have done that are simple applications of concepts I learnt in my years 
studying finance in universities around the world.

## 1. Fund Analysis
Is a framework for the analysis of fund returns that looks at the risk-adjusted performance metrics relative to a certain number of benchmarks.

## 2. Simple Financial Database
Is a program written using object-oriented programming that returns certain info about stocks or a number of stocks (volume, price, industry sector).

## 3. Taylor Rule Implementation
